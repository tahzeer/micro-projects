# Mini Projects Repository

Welcome to my Mini Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of quick mini projects that I have created. These projects are designed to be completed in a short amount of time, usually within a day. They cover various topics and technologies, providing practical examples and learning opportunities.

## Usage

To use the projects in this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the repository by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP". Alternatively, you can clone the repository using Git.

2. Unpack the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location on your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the unpacked repository using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/unpacked/repository
   ```

4. Start a local development server to run the mini projects. If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `http-server` package to run a local server. Install it globally by running:
   ```
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

   Then, navigate to the project directory and start the server:
   ```
   cd path/to/unpacked/repository
   http-server
   ```

5. Once the local server is running, you can access the mini projects in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:8080` or the provided local server address.
